# Collab-Editor
A Real-time Collaborative Editor using Node.js, WebSockets, and React

## Overview

## Getting Started

To run the Collab-Editor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Collab-Editor.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install express ws cors`
3. Start the server: `npm start server.js`
